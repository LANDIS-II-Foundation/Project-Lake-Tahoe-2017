# Harvesting description:

The underlying stand and management area maps are available in the following folder:						
https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Project-Lake-Tahoe-2017/tree/master/LTW_LANDIS_Scenarios/HarvestMaps						
		
Harvest Extension details:						
Each prescription requires at least three things: 1) a way to choose which stands to harvest (stand ranking), 2) a list of which species-age cohorts to target, and 3) a list of how much area of each management zone should be harvested						
						
Species-age targets:						
See the following files on github (link above) for how presciptions were developed:						
fuel-treatments-LTW-ExtendedWUI.txt						
fuel-treatments-LTW-WUI-focused.txt

Prescription implementation below (also available in the same files as above.
