Insect Extension description:
There are several options for outbreak pattern, ranging from cylical to chronic.  Outbreaks are modified by:
1) Environmental and/or other disturbance-related stress like fire, wind, or harvest (Site Resource Modifiers).
2) The abundance of host in the neighborhood surrounding the site (Neighborhood Resource Dominance).
3) User-defined temporal functions (e.g., cyclic, random, or chronic) that affect the temporal pattern of disturbances across the entire spatial domain of the simulation (Regional Outbreak Status).
4) Spatial epidemic zones defined via simulated dispersal of a BDA through a heterogeneous landscape (Dispersal).

Currently three species of insects are included in the model: Jeffrey Pine Beetle, Mountain Pine Beetle, and Fir Engraver.

Other notes:  Jonathan Long would like White Pine Blister Rust modeled.
