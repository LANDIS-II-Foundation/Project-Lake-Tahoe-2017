# Scenarios and Model Inputs
This directory contains all the models inputs necessary to run the four primary scenarios developed through many iterations with the Stakehold Advisory group and the Design Team.  Their scenarios were subsequently translated into model inputs.
To look at corresponding prescriptions associated with each scenario:

Scenario | file name
--- | ---
Scenario1 | no treatment
Scenario2 | fuel-treatments-LTW-WUI-focused.txt
Scenario3 | fuel-treatments-LTW-WUI-ExtendedWUI.txt
Scenario4 | fuel-treatments-LTW-WUI-focused_extendedRX.txt

For the fire parameters:

Scenarios 1 - 3 use SCRAPPLE_LTW.txt
Scenario 4 uses SCRAPPLE_LTW_ExpandedRX.txt
